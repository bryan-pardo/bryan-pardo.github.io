## Course Description

WARNING: This course is about reading papers. A lot of papers. If you don't want to read and discuss papers, this is not the course for you.

DESCRIPTION: One of the most exciting areas of research in deep learning is that of generative models. This course is dedicated to understanding the inner workings of the technologies that underlie these advances. Students will primarily learn about how Transformers, Variational Autoencoders, Reinforcement Learning and Diffusion Models are used to create text documents, write code, create music, images, speech, and more. We'll also look at legal and ethical implications of these models.  This is an advanced course that presumes a good working understanding of traditional supervised neural network technology and techniques (e.g. convolutional networks, LSTMs, loss functions, regularization, gradient descent). 

PREREQUISITES: Course admission is by permission of instructor. The best Northwestern course to prepare for this class is CS 449 Deep Learning, although being a doctoral student in CS will likely get you in, even if you haven't taken CS 449.

## Course assignments

### Reading: 40 points 
You will submit 20 one-page reviews of readings from the course website. 10 of these must be papers (not lecture slides, actual papers) scheduled for presenation in the course calendar. 10 of these can be chosen from the full set of readings for the course. Note...even though this class is about generative models, use of a generative model is not allowed in writing these up. The point is to have your own thoughts...and communicate your own thoughts on the page. 

### Class Paper Presentation: 40 points
Once during the course of the term, you will be the lead in discussing the reading in class. This will mean you haven't just read the paper, but you've read related work, really understand it and can give a 30-minute (maximum) presentation of the paperand then lead a discussion about it.
Note, you are not allowed to go over 30 minutes in your presentation. Keeping to the time limit is part of the grade.

<ul>
<li>10 points: 1-on-1 meeting prior to the presentation, to go over slides and talking points</li>
<li>10 points: Initial slides at time of 1-on-1 meeting</li>
<li>15 points: Presenting topic (30 minutes) with updated slides & leading discussion (15 minutes)  </li>
<li>5  points:  Final submitted slides, updated in response to feedback from presentation </li>
</ul>

### Class Participation 10 points
For 2 papers that are presented in class (not your own), you are expected to be in class, on time, and really up on the material. I will feel free to call on you repeatedly and expect you to be engaged and give informed, thoughtful answers. Don't expect full points for this if you give brief or uninformed answers. You will be able to sign up for these papers at the start of the term. 

### Final Exam 10 points
Your final exam is this: I will select a paper that you did a review of and you'll spend 5 minutes talking about it, answering my questions as you go. If I believe you really read and understood the paper, full points.
